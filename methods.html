						<h3>Research methodologies and methods</h3>
						<p>
							Research methodologies specify how to structure a research, what methods to apply, how to measure progress and what to consider as success.
							Clarke, R. J. (2005) states, that methodologies utilise a research model and specify concept of related research methods. 
							Methodologies vary in different approaches that can be taken and different questions that can be asked.  Methodologies show guidelines for each specific research and help a research choose the correct way to select method of collecting data. When researching a question, there are two main approaches which we can take. Fistr main method is quantitave research. This method generates data that can be converted into numbers. Second method of research is qualitatiave method which uses variety of questions and generates non-numerical information. These approaches differ in methods of collecting data. Many scientists now believe that there is no major problem that could not be answered while studied with combination of these two methods. (Denscomble, 2007)

							This video below explains basic research metholdogies, guide how to start research and what is needed to complete it.

						<h3>Chosen methodology</h3>
						<p>
						For this research descriptive research methodology has been chosen because it successfully meets our requirements. This methodology uses human observation and responses as way to collect data. There are three ways which research can use this methodology. First method of gathering data is observational. This method uses viewing and recording interviewee or subjects of a research in their natural environment. Second method of collecting data using descriptive methodology is case study. Case study is in-depth study of individuals or groups of participants. Case study uses interviews, questioners or open conversation about specific topic. Last method used in descriptive methodology is survey. Surveys are useful tool to collect all sort of information by asking simple questions regarding a topic of research. (Kowalczyk, none)
						<br>
						<br>
						When using descriptive methodology both quantitative and qualitative methods can be used within a single research. This enables researcher combine different methods of collecting data. In this scenario surveys and interview has been chosen as the most suitable method for collecting data. Survey enables filtrate participants into groups which can be later interview for the best results. However Dudovskiy (none) states that there are disadvantages to descriptive research. By using descriptive methodology, researchers cannot verify problem by using statistics. Researches also may reflect their personal opinions due high volume of interviews and lack of statistics.
						<br>
						<br>
						Use of another methodology has been considered. Considered methodology was comparative methodology. This methodology compares different experiences in societies and uses experimental research. This methodology works hand-in-hand with historical methodology which establishes facts and conclusions about past events. Although comparative and historical methodologies work closely together, it is difficult to provide real facts when using them. Therefore these two methodologies have not been used.
