						<h3>Latest advancements in Virtualisation</h3>
					</div>	
						<div class="box2">
							<p>	
							As digital data continue to grow, businesses of all sizes are looking for ways to lower their budget and improve their services. Enterprise mobile technology at the application level is huge trend, because it enables virtualisation only where needed. This movement towards fewer computing and less storage may generate new positions for virtualisation administrators and engineers. Lathika (2016) states, that the idea to create easier management and increase computing resources with reducing cost of physical hardware is step into the future.
							<br>
							<br>
							This goes hand-in-hand with security. Security of virtualised environments is still very debated topic, however Lathika (2016) also states that attacks on virtualised environments are hyper jacking and virtual machine jumping. Although hyper jacking is still only theoretical scenario, it should get attention. This opens area of jobs that can be created thanks to virtualisation. Security administrators will be necessary component in the future of virtualisation.
