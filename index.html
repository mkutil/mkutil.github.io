				<h2>The Impact of Virtualisation on small to medium-sized businesses</h2>
					<br>
					<div class="box2">
						<h3>Introduction</h3>
						<p>
						 Traditionally computers and servers are one set of hardware running one set of software. Virtualisation dismantles these boundaries between hardware and software and enables multiple sets of software to be managed by one set of hardware. Current virtualisation situation has created new exiting opportunities for new research on both hardware and software sites. Virtual machines can further increase reliability and maximize hardware usage. According to Fisher-Ogden (none) virtualisation can be used in many ways. Software developers can take advantage of virtualisation portability, testing capabilities or its debugging opportunities. With such a high development around virtualisation, its cost decreases while its performance increases. This is a reason why virtualisation draws attention from small to mid-sized businesses
						 <br><br>
						 This assignment describes benefits of virtualisation for small businesses. Research according impact of virtualisation has been conducted and findings are available in chapter Findings. Industry chapter describes major virtualisation organisation, discuss jobs in IT field and major virtualisation advancements. Chapter Methods discuss methodologies of research and describe chosen methods for this scenario. Professional scope evaluates efficiency of virtualisation for small businesses and its security. Lastly Personal Development chapter critically evaluate this project and undertaken research, with PDP and GAP analysis.

						<h3>Justification of the Research</h3>
						<p>
							Virtualisation reduces real risks of IT systems downtime, outages and data loss for all businesses. For small to mid-sized businesses loss of critical data because of disaster or emergency can lead to loss of customers, sales or the whole business. Opara and Soluade (2013) state benefits of virtualisation for small businesses can improve stability of systems, improve security and decrease downtime. This research aims to answer a question if virtualisation is positive step to take and what impact virtualisation has for small to mid-sized businesses.
